//
// A .toml familiar is a Codex agent file. The reader takes one subset of TOML
// and calls everything else "cannot check": top-level `key = value` lines,
// blank lines, whole-line comments, and the seal block. A value is a string,
// or an unquoted true or false for a key the contract lists. A table, an
// array, an inline table, a number, a date, a dotted or quoted key and any
// text after a value's close, a comment included, are refused. `[mcp_servers]`
// and the like are valid to Codex, but a table is where a key hides from this
// check, so none is read.
//
// Strings are read the narrow way, as parseDoubleQuoted reads YAML. A basic
// string, "…" or """…""", takes the escapes \" and \\ and no other: a \u
// escape could spell a character the invisible-character rule never sees in
// the raw text. A literal string, '…' or '''…''', takes none, and two single
// quotes in a row inside one are refused. A close with a longer quote run
// than its delimiter is refused too, so the reader closes a string exactly
// where TOML does, and a key after it cannot hide inside it.
//
// The seal is three comment lines at the very end of the file, which Codex
// reads past. They are found by the same pass that knows whether a line is
// inside a string: the same three lines inside a string are text, and stay in
// the digest. Any other comment that names a mark key, in any case or form,
// is refused, because it would read as a seal to a person or a model. So is a
// key named like one, listed or not: no tool reads such a key, and it too
